01 FOUNDERS
Two years free education,
two years paid work.
Overview
Introducing the 01 Founders curriculum - a highquality software engineering course - based
on the established 01 Edu platform.
Over two years of study and two years of
work, you’ll develop full-stack developer
skills. In other words, you’ll graduate ready for
employment, with mid-level, rather than entrylevel coding ability.
Over the Fellowship you’ll gain in-depth
exposure to a selection of relevant software
engineering fields, through a mixture of
group and independent work. The two-year
course consists of the initial 1-month Selection
Pool, followed by 18 months of Core software
engineering and programming training, and
6 months of Specialisation on a topic of your
choice.
Welcome

Overview 01 FOUNDERS
Over the first two years of the Fellowship, you will complete over 50 projects. Across these you will
learn how to use Javascript, Go, and Rust - as well as having the opportunity to work on projects
in C, C++, Ruby-on-Rails, PHP, and Python. As you progress you can work on projects that interest
you most before you enter employment.

Overview 01 FOUNDERS
The first step in the application process is the
Online Cognitive Testthat evaluates your
logical thinking and problem solving skills.
Like the 01F syllabus, this consists of two games
which won’t take you longer than two hours to
complete. Note - this is meant to be challenging,
so do perservere if you get stuck!
How to apply
The second step in the application process
is the Selection Pool. This involves a 4 week
intensive period at the 01F Campus where you’ll
learn the basics of the coding language Go.
This will be your first experience of the 01F education
model - a blend of group projects and individual
assessments, and is a challenging in-person
period from which the final cohort is selected.

Tuition &
Financing
There are no tuition fees at
01 Founders.
We believe education should be accessible to
everyone, irrespective of previous qualifications,
experience or financial status.
Whilst you pay 0 fees for 2 years education, we
understand that some learners will not be able to afford
living expenses during this time.
As a result, we are providing a limited number of
scholarships on a means-tested basis to learners. Please
contact theteam@01founders.co for more information.
Coding skills give you the
ability to shape the world
around you, but for too long,
access to these opportunities
has been unevenly distributed.
We’re building 01 Founders to
remove the barriers to jobready technical training.

Taking on an apprentice, if you're an employer:
Overview
Apprentices are aged 16 or over and combine working with studying to gain skills and knowledge in a specific job.

This guidance is for employers in England.

Apprentices can be new or current employees.

You must pay the apprentice at least the minimum wage.

Apprenticeships must last at least a year. They can last up to 5 years depending on the level the apprentice is studying.

Your responsibilities
You’re responsible for making sure your apprentice:

works with experienced staff
learns job-specific skills
gets time off during their working week for apprenticeship training
Hiring an apprentice

There are several steps to taking on an apprentice.

1. Choose an apprenticeship for your business or organisation.

 
2. Find an organisation that offers training for the apprenticeship you’ve chosen.

 
3. Check what training funding you can get.

 
4. Create an account - you need this to manage funding and recruit apprentices.

 
5. Advertise your apprenticeship - find out how to create an advert or give your training provider permission to do this for you.

 
6. Make an apprenticeship agreement and training plan with your chosen apprentice.

If you do not want to hire and train the apprentice yourself, you can use a flexi-job apprenticeship agency. The apprentice will be employed by the agency but will work in your organisation.

Get funding for apprenticeship training
You can get help from the government to pay for apprenticeship training.

You might be able to get an additional payment of £1,000, depending on the apprentice you hire.

What funding you can get
You can get money to go towards the cost of training and assessment. The amount you get depends on whether you pay the apprenticeship levy or not.

Find out if you need to pay the apprenticeship levy.

If you do not pay the apprenticeship levy
You pay 5% towards the cost of training and assessing your apprentice. You need to:

agree a payment schedule with the training provider
pay them directly for the training
The government will pay the rest (95%) up to the funding band maximum. They’ll pay it directly to the training provider.

If your apprentice started before 1 April 2019, you contribute 10% towards the cost of training and assessing your apprentice and the government pays the rest (90%). This rate continues until your apprentice completes their training.

Use your apprenticeships service account to manage funding and provider payments.

You could get extra funding depending on both your and your apprentice’s circumstances. Check the funding rules to see if you’re eligible.

If you pay the apprenticeship levy
You’ll get funds to spend on training and assessing your apprentices. The government will add 10%.

Find out how to pay the apprenticeship levy.

Use your apprenticeships service account to manage funding and provider payments.

You cannot use funds from your apprenticeship service account to pay for a flexi-job apprenticeship agency’s services.

Help to pay for other costs
You can get £1,000 to support your apprentice in the workplace if they are one of the following:

16 to 18 years old
19 to 25 years old with an education, health and care plan
19 to 25 years old and they used to be in care
If your apprentice is eligible, your training provider will give you the payment in 2 instalments of £500. You will get the first payment after 90 days and the second one after a year.

Eligibility
Employers and training providers could get £1,000 each for taking on an apprentice who is either:

aged 16 to 18 years old, or
aged 19 to 25 years old and has an education, health and care (EHC) plan or has been in the care of their local authority
What you can use the payment for
You can spend it on any costs associated with supporting an apprentice in the workplace.

For example, on uniforms, your apprentice’s travel or their salary.

How to get the payment
Employers do not need to take any action.

We use confirmation from the training provider that an apprentice is eligible and calculate payments.

Training providers must get consent from apprentices who have EHC plans or have been in the care of their local authority to share this information with the employer. Payment will not be calculated for employers if consent is not provided.

When you’ll get paid
The first payment of £500 should be paid to the employer by the training provider after 90 days of the apprenticeship training start date.

The final payment of £500 should be paid to the employer by the training provider after 365 days of the apprenticeship training start date.

Training providers have 30 working days to make payment to employers.

Who needs to pay Apprenticeship Levy
Apprenticeship Levy is an amount paid at a rate of 0.5% of an employer’s annual pay bill.

As an employer, you have to pay Apprenticeship Levy each month if you:

have an annual pay bill of more than £3 million
are connected to any companies or charities for Employment Allowance purposes and have a combined annual pay bill of more than £3 million
The rules for connected companies are the same for Apprenticeship Levy and Employment Allowance.

You must report and pay Apprenticeship Levy monthly through your Employee Payment Summary.

All sectors must pay the levy if they have an annual pay bill of over £3 million (including any connected companies or charities).

The sectors that have specific rules for paying Apprenticeship Levy are:

franchises
off-payroll working
short-lived companies
managed service companies
employment or recruitment agencies
joint ventures
schools
Your annual pay bill
Your annual pay bill is all payments to employees that are subject to employer Class 1 secondary National Insurance contributions such as wages, bonuses and commissions.

Your pay bill must include payments to:

all employees earning below the lower earnings limit and the secondary threshold
employees under the age of 21
apprentices under the age of 25
Your pay bill must not include earnings:

of employees under the age of 16
of employees who are not subject to UK National Insurance contributions legislation
on which Class 1A National Insurance contributions are payable, such as benefits in kind
Industry training levy contributions
You’ll still need to pay Apprenticeship Levy even if you already contribute to an industry-wide training levy arrangement (for example the Construction Industry Training Board Levy).

Employers with modified PAYE schemes
If you run a modified PAYE scheme you need to account for National Insurance contributions as usual. Use a best estimate of all earnings that are subject to Class 1 secondary National Insurance contributions to check if you need to pay the Apprenticeship Levy. You need to submit an Employment Payment Summary each month using these estimated figures.

At the end of the tax year, you also need to:

check your estimated pay bill against the actual figures for the tax year
submit an extra Employment Payment Summary to correct any difference and pay any Apprenticeship Levy owed
Using your Apprenticeship Levy allowance
The allowance reduces the amount of Apprenticeship Levy you have to pay by £15,000 across the year.

You cannot carry over any unused allowance into the next tax year.

If you start or stop being an employer part way through the tax year you can use your full annual Apprenticeship Levy allowance against the amount of the levy that you owe.

Employers not connected to another company or charity
Employers not connected to another company or charity will have an Apprenticeship Levy allowance of £15,000 each year.

If you are not connected to any other employer and your pay bill is not over £3 million you will not need to pay the levy.

Employers connected to other companies or charities
Connected companies or charities will only have one £15,000 allowance to share between them.

If you are connected to any other employer and your combined pay bill is below £3 million, you will not need to pay the levy.

How to divide your allowance
Your Apprenticeship Levy allowance of £15,000 can be divided between:

all your PAYE schemes
your connected companies or charities
You can decide how to split the allowance between your PAYE schemes or with your connected companies or charities. You must report how you’ve divided your allowance the first time you have to pay Apprenticeship Levy. You cannot change your share of the allowance during the tax year.

You must continue to apply the levy allowance that was divided at the beginning of the tax year if, part way through the year:

you become a connected employer (such as by merging with or acquiring another company)
the structure of your group of connected companies or connected charities changes (such as by demerging with another company)
You can decide how you divided your levy allowance across your connected companies or charities at the start of the next tax year.

You cannot change where the allowance has been divided across connected companies or charities at the end of the tax year.

Employers with multiple PAYE schemes who do not use their full Apprenticeship Levy allowance during the year, can change how this has been divided at the end of the tax year. This can be done to offset any unused allowance against another of your schemes.

Public bodies (excluding charities) each get a full Apprenticeship Levy allowance as they are not considered to be connected companies. Public bodies which are charities must follow the rules for connected charities.

NHS trusts and other health service bodies (such as Scottish Health Boards, Welsh Local Health Boards and Health and Social Care Trusts in Northern Ireland) are considered to be companies and have to follow the connected companies’ rules.

Work out what you owe
Apprenticeship Levy is charged at 0.5% of your annual pay bill. You can use HMRC’s Basic PAYE Tools to help you work out how much you need to pay.

For the first month of the tax year:

1. Divide your Apprenticeship Levy allowance by 12.
2. Subtract this figure from 0.5% of your monthly pay bill.

For each of the following months:

1.Work out your total pay bill for the year to date.

 
2.Add up your monthly levy allowances for the year to date.

 
3.Subtract your levy allowance for the year to date from 0.5% of your total pay bill for the year to date.

 
4.Subtract the amount of the levy you’ve paid in the year to date.

If you start paying the levy part way through the tax year, you need to:

Work out how much of your annual allowance has been accumulated in the current year.

 
Divide your full annual allowance by 12.

 
Multiply by the number of months since the start of the tax year.

This figure is your allowance for the first month you report the levy. Any unused allowance can be carried forward into the next month within the same tax year.

Reporting how much you owe
You must report to HMRC how much Apprenticeship Levy you owe each month. You must report this at the start of the tax year if:

your annual pay bill (including any connected companies or charities) in the previous tax year was more than £3 million
you think your annual pay bill (including any connected companies or charities) for the tax year will be more than £3 million
if your annual pay bill (including any connected companies or charities) unexpectedly increases to more than £3 million — start reporting when this happens
If you’ve started paying Apprenticeship Levy, you must continue reporting it until the end of the tax year even if your annual pay bill turns out to be less than £3 million.

Connected companies or charities will each need to tell HMRC how much Apprenticeship Levy they owe.

Report your Apprenticeship Levy each month using your Employer Payment Summary and include the amount of the:

annual Apprenticeship Levy allowance you’ve divided to that PAYE scheme
Apprenticeship Levy you owe to date in the current tax year
You do not need to report Apprenticeship Levy on your Employment Payment Summary if you have not had to pay it in the current tax year.

Record keeping
You must keep records of any information you have used to work out your levy payment for at least 3 years after the tax year which they relate to.

Reporting changes to your pay bill
Report any changes to the Apprenticeship Levy as a result of changes to your pay bill on your next Employment Payment Summary. If you find errors in your total annual pay bill at the end of the tax year, you must submit an extra Employment Payment Summary with the correct Apprenticeship Levy for the full tax year and pay what you owe.

How to pay
You pay Apprenticeship Levy every month as part of your PAYE bill. If you’ve overpaid Apprenticeship Levy during the year, you’ll receive a refund as a PAYE credit.

Apprenticeship Levy payments are a deductible expense for Corporation Tax.

Specific sectors that need to pay Apprenticeship Levy
There are specific rules for certain sectors but all must pay the levy if they have an annual pay bill of over £3 million (including any connected companies or charities).

Franchises
Franchises have an annual allowance of £15,000 for all the franchises under your control. You can choose to share the allowance across the franchises you control or across your PAYE schemes.

Off-payroll working
You must include payments to intermediaries, such as a personal service company, a partnership or other individual, which are subject to the off-payroll working rules. This applies to payments for services provided through intermediaries to:

public authorities (from April 2017)
medium and large-sized clients outside the public sector (from April 2021)
These payments are treated as employment income and subject to Class 1 National Insurance contributions.

This does not apply to payments for services provided through intermediaries to private sector clients that are small or have no UK connection.

Short-lived companies
Short lived companies such as special purpose vehicles will have to pay the levy if they’re liable for Class 1 secondary National Insurance contributions. You’ll have a full £15,000 allowance if the special purpose vehicle has been set up part way through the tax year. You must to check whether you’re connected to another company or charity at the start of the following tax year.

Managed service companies
If you’re a managed service company and you’re connected to another employer, you may also have to pay the levy if your pay bill is less than £3 million.

Employment or recruitment agencies
You must pay the levy if you:

supply labour (including subcontractors) to a client
pay Class 1 secondary National Insurance contributions on the earnings of those workers
Joint ventures
If you’re in a joint venture partnership where 2 companies each have a 50% share in a further company, neither company will have overall control.

As a result, the joint venture would not be connected to any other companies. The 2 companies and the joint venture would therefore each be entitled to their own levy allowance of £15,000.

Other types of joint ventures will get a full £15,000 allowance if they’ve been set up part way through the tax year. They’ll need to check if they’re connected to another employer at the start of the next tax year to work out their allowance for the following year.

Schools
For voluntary-aided schools, foundation schools, free schools and academies, the governing body is the employer. Each governing body will be entitled to an allowance of £15,000.

For other maintained schools, the local authority is the employer. The local authority remains legally responsible for payment of the Apprenticeship Levy for schools under their control, even if they’ve delegated responsibility for payroll including payment of Class 1 secondary National Insurance contributions. Each local authority has an annual allowance of £15,000.

The employer for faith schools will be the local authority if the school is voluntary-controlled, otherwise it will be the governing body.

Multi-academy trusts will get a single annual allowance of £15,000.

If a school becomes a voluntary-aided school, foundation school, free school or academy part way through a tax year, the academy’s governing body will be responsible for the Apprenticeship Levy from this point and get a full allowance of £15,000.
